"what_is_powernap_full" = "PowerNap is a scientific nap application designed for Apple Watch users, precisely controlling ideal short rest periods to help you fully recharge during the day. Research shows that 10-20 minute short naps are the ideal rest length, effectively avoiding deep sleep and preventing grogginess upon waking. Our app allows you to freely choose 1-30 minute ideal nap durations, and through intelligent detection, only starts timing after you truly fall asleep, ensuring optimal results from every nap.\n\nScientific research has confirmed the amazing benefits of short naps: NASA research found that approximately 26-minute naps can increase pilot work performance by 34% and alertness by 54%. Other studies have also confirmed that 5-15 minute short naps can immediately reduce fatigue, improve cognitive performance, with effects lasting 1-3 hours. Regular napping can also improve attention, strengthen working memory and learning ability, reduce stress levels, and even improve emotional control and increase frustration tolerance. For this reason, the US military also recommends \"tactical naps\" as a key strategy for maintaining high-performance.\n\nPowerNap's breakthrough design lies in detecting when you truly fall asleep - combining heart rate monitoring and motion detection technology, the app identifies when your heart rate drops below a specific percentage of your resting heart rate, determining you have entered sleep state, then begins countdown. This solves the two major problems of traditional alarms: \"being woken before falling asleep\" or \"sleeping too long and feeling more tired\". When your nap time ends, the app gently wakes you with vibration and sound, allowing you to immediately return to wakefulness and enjoy the cognitive and physical benefits of napping.\n\nPowerNap's interface is carefully designed, simple and intuitive, completely aligned with Apple Watch usage habits. Whether during work breaks, study intervals, or afternoon energy lows, you can activate PowerNap in just seconds, letting this wrist device help you master the art of scientific napping, making every day full of energy.";

Directly uninstall this app\nOur goal is to help you sleep better. If PowerNap doesn't help, it shouldn't occupy space on your watch.\n\n2. Try improving your routine to increase accuracy\nPowerNap has extremely high accuracy for users with stable heart rates and regular schedules. If you can adjust lifestyle habits, diet, and sleep environment, it will not only help improve detection effectiveness, but also make your physical and mental state healthier.\n\nRegardless of which path you choose, PowerNap wishes you better sleep and more energetic days!";
